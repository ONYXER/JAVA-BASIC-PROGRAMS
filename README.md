In this program i use Queue framework,
<br>
firstly i take number of processes and number of resources from the user as a input.
<br>
then i define 4 matrics using arrays named allocate,maxneed,need ,avil, and then take within respective resources instances <br>
then i find the actual need of processes to going to safe mode <br>
then create two Queues named executed and nonexecuted <br>
that process need<avail then store it in executed queue otherwise store in nonexecuted. repeate this process util nonexecuted Queuebecomes empty.
